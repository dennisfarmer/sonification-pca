# Scientific Interface

Web Application that allows uploading a csv, and producing a sonification of it.

Unfinished because I pivoted the project to the Dash application (sonification of PCA); writing html forms is really tedious so I think I'll rewrite this as a Dash application as well (pure python, would make streaming ChucK audio output much easier)
